    <h3>Lab #1 Technical Report</h3>
    <ol style="color:blue">
        <li>How did you password protect your page (what method)? 
            <p style="color:cadetblue">To password protect my page, I used my search engine and had to figure out the multiple ways there are to do so. Still leaning HTML, I found a method that I understood completely and believed I could implement. 
            The password method I used is a simple Java Script that enables a prompt when the index.html is initially opened. Going through a couple conditionals, if the password is correct it will allow access to the website. If not, it continues to ask.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>What new tag did you try? What was its effect?
            <p style="color:cadetblue">Being new to HTML, I decided to try a tag I was very curious about from the start, the image tag. I was eager to learn how to add and source image files in my webpage. That 	is exactly what I tried with the image tag and it did so.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Does your page look different in different browsers?
            <p style="color:cadetblue">
            My page does not look different in different browsers, mainly because I believe the page 	is carrying out simple elements that do not change according to browser.                
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)
            <p style="color:cadetblue">
            I spent less than an hour on this lab.
